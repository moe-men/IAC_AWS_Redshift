- An advantage of being in the cloud is the ability to create infrastructure, i.e. machines, users, roles, folders, and processes using code. creating such parts can be done by either the GUI or we code it.


- However creating an AWS Redshift cluster by the Quick Launcher is a fully-functional one, but we need more functionality.
	-Security:

		- The cluster is accessible only from the virtual private cloud

		- We need to access it from our jupyter workspace

	-Access to S3:

		- The cluster needs to access an S3 bucket

- IaC lets you automate, maintain, deploy, replicate and share complex infrastructures as easily as you maintain code.
